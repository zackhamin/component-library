# useClickOutside

The `useClickOutside` hook accepts two arguments: `ref` which is a ref to the element outside of which you want to register the click and a `callback` which is a function that will be called when the click happens.

```jsx
const ref = useRef(null);

useClickOutside(ref, () => {
	// event handler
});

return <div ref={ref}>Click outside of me to trigger the event handler</div>;
```
